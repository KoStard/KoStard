### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ruben, and I'm just a curious person who loves using philosophical ideas and answers to solve real-world problems. My moments of wonder have led me to study and use programming for these purposes (more than 6 years of professional experience).

As a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, I'm passionate about solving problems that matter and always looking for new challenges. I work on making cross-border expansion easier for our sellers and bringing more products to our customers.

While I started as a self-taught programmer, I also graduated from the University of Luxembourg with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Informatics. I love building cool and simple solutions to problems frequently invisible at the first sight. I love finding and learning to use the best tools available at the moment, understand how and why they were built the certain way and when necessary build my own ones. I love sharing those with the open source community.

I'm always happy to collaborate and learn with others, so if you're interested in chatting about the development process or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kostard/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ko_stard).
