### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ruben, and I'm just a curious person who loves using philosophical ideas and answers to solve real-world problems. My moments of wonder have led me to study and use programming for these purposes (more than 5 years of professional experience).

As a Software Development Engineer at Amazon, I'm passionate about solving problems that matter and always looking for new challenges. I work on making cross-border expansion easier for our sellers and bringing more products to our customers.

While I started as a self-taught programmer, I'm now graduating from the University of Luxembourg with a Bachelor's degree in Applied Informatics. Currently, I'm learning everything I can find about the process of getting from an idea to a product, including product management, design, and business. I'm applying these ideas to my own projects, aiming to create a healthy development process without slowing down product development.

I'm always happy to collaborate and learn with others, so if you're interested in chatting about the development process or want to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me. You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kostard/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ko_stard).
